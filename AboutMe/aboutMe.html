    <p>Hi! my name is Charles Turner, but most of my friends know me as Jonathan. I am a student in NSCC's IT for Database Administration program. Since childhood I've been interested in computers and that's what ultimately led me to this course. Outside of school, I play the trumpet, although I've been getting a bit rusty since leaving high school. My favourite song to play in the band was The Hounds of Spring by Alfred Reed (there's a spotify link below). I also used to play piano but that was back in the fourth grade and I've lost nearly all of it. I have a nice mic for recording when I do play, a mic from Maono, but it sees more use on my twitch channel these days. Speaking of, I occasionally do broadcasts on twitch.tv when I can.</p>
